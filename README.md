# My Personal Portfolio Site 

### Well.. This is self explanatory I guess ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Check it out at: [johnroussos.me](https://johnroussos.me/) 

## The what

I learned a lot building this site, mainly how to create complex animation such as the "magnet" effect I used in the links or the smooth scrolling on the page horizontal and vertical. 

## The how 

### I used: 
[gsap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gsap) for all the animations in the page.<br> 
[react-intersection-observer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-intersection-observer) for triggering some actions. <br>
[react-device-detect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-device-detect) for serving different versions of the page in mobile and browser. <br>
[firebase](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase) for hosting, storage, database and analytics

### Problems & solutions: 

I was using the ticker functionality of gsap for the smooth scroll of the page and also the projects slider but I noticed that for some reason I was having a few droped frames here and there, and in firefox it was basically unusable (major lags). And the solution was to switch to a good old requestAnimationFrame. 


## To do next

This project is almost finished, however I have some more ideas that may end up in the final version.

- Morph svg dot in other shapes depending the content
- Add a marquee text as divider between sections
- Render images dynamicaly
- Connect firebase storage and database

In a later version I'm planning on building a detailed page for each project, containing specifics and characteristics for the project at stake.
